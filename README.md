# Java-AlphabetAnimation
This simple Java project generates a unique pattern of characters, starting from 'A' and cycling through the alphabet until it reaches the corresponding letter from the "HELLOWORLD" string. It prints each pattern with a 0.5-second delay, gradually building up the characters in the ArrayList.
